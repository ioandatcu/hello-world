# hello-world
I need some advice :)
I'm an aircraft engineering student and I want to improve myself in more than just the engineering branch. Since I probably won't be able to attend any lectures for a long time, I've decided to start off a new chapter in my academic life. I currently have basic knowledge in how HTML works and I would like to excell in this branch so any tips or advices are more than welcome.
